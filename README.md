# Floodwatch Bangladesh
A mobile app that assists Bangladeshi fisherfolk figure out when and where is best to fish by checking the water levels in surrounding locations.
This is a part of a project with Oxfam and Monash University called 'PROTIC II' and was assembled as a team of six:
- Lucas Berry (Team Lead)
- Aiden D'Andrea (Backend)
- Adrian Chiera (Frontend)
- David Waite (Frontend)
- Jeremy Giddings (Full Stack)
- Sothearak Heng (Full Stack)

This public copy includes the 1.0 version of the app (excluding any values relating to the database for obvious reasons).
